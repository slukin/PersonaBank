There once was a narrator and a teller.  The teller was at a window.  A financial center wasn't busy.  The narrator was bored because the financial center wasn't busy.  

A man and a woman entered the financial center.  

The man and the woman approached the window in order to deposit a bank bill.  

The teller asked the man and the woman whether had banked with the financial center.  

The narrator stopped being bored, and the woman said that the man had banked with the financial center and because he was unfaithful and glared at him.  

The man cursed the woman and said that -- if the woman isn't quiet -- the man would beat the woman.  

The woman dared the man to beat the woman because he and the woman was in the public eye.  

The man said that he later took the woman from the financial center and later beat the woman.  

The teller said that the bank bill was needing approval.  

The teller departed in order to approve the bank bill.  

The man said that -- if the woman isn't quiet -- the man would depart.  

The woman said that the man had already departed.  

The teller returned.  

The teller said that she wasn't able to deposit the bank bill.  

The man and the woman decided to leave the financial center.  

The man and the woman began to leave the financial center.  

The woman said that she hoped for the teller and the narrator to not later begin to be married because every man was unfaithful.  

The man and the woman stopped leaving the financial center, and she winked at the teller and the narrator.  

The teller and the narrator laughed.
