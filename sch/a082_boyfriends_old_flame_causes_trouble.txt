There once was a girl and a boy.  The girl was liking the boy.  The boy was liking her.  

A narrator who wanted to date the boy told the boy that she wanted to date the boy.  

The boy left the girl in order to date the girl and began to be the boyfriend of the narrator.  

The girl began to be very hurt, and the boy tried to befriend with the girl.  

The girl began to not talk to the boy.  

The girl stopped not talking to the boy and befriended with the boy.  

The narrator wanted to meet the girl because the girl had befriended with the boy.  

The boy didn't allow the narrator to meet the girl because -- if the girl were to later meet the narrator -- she would begin to be very sad.
