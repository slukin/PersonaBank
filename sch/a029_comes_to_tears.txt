A man searched a bag for a group of kies.  

The man retrieved the group of kies.  

The man opened a door of a house with the group of kies.  

The man entered the house and began to be afraid because he wasn't well-behaved.  

The man removed a shoe and a second shoe.  

The man dropped the bag onto a sofa.  

The man entered the kitchen of the house in order to make a tea.  

The man numbly wandered the kitchen of the house and tried to not remember past.  

The man tried to reach a mug.  

A hand of the man hit against a pan.  

The man cursed the pan and clasped the hand of the man against the chest of the man.  

The man began to be crying and slumped on the floor of the kitchen of the house against a counter.  

The man held the head of the man and sobbed.
