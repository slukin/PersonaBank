A narrator placed a steely and large bowl on a back deck in order for a dog to drink the water of the bowl.  

The bowl began to be popular, and a group of birds drank the water of the bowl and bathed the group of birds in the bowl.  

The group of birds organized itself on the railing of the deck and in order to wait.  

A group of squirrels drank the water of the bowl.  

A crazy second squirrel approached the bowl.  

The second squirrel began to be startled because it saw the reflection of the second squirrel.  

The second squirrel leaped because it was startled and fell over the railing of the deck and because it leaped.  

The second squirrel held the railing of the deck with a paw of the second squirrel.  

The second squirrel fell, and the paw of the second squirrel slipped off the railing of the deck.
