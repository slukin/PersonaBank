There once was a narrator and the husband of the narrator.  The narrator owned a home.  The narrator was loving the husband of the narrator.  She was working in an office.  

An exterminator entered the office.  

The narrator thought that the exterminator was extremely sexually attractive.  

The exterminator spoke.  

The narrator thought that a voice of the exterminator was sexually attractive.  

The narrator remembered that she had dated a group of men who was as sexually attractive as the exterminator.  

The narrator thought that the exterminator was more sexually attractive than the group of men.  

The narrator stopped being working and returned to the home.  

The narrator saw that the husband of the narrator had prepared some extremely tasty dinner.  

The narrator decided that -- if the exterminator were to want to tempt her -- the narrator would not trade the husband of the narrator for the exterminator because she was loving him.
