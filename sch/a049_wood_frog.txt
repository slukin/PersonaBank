There once was a narrator.  The narrator was loading some firewood into a shed.  

A wood frog hopped around some grass and near a foot of the narrator.  

The narrator stopped loading the firewood, suspected that a moth had hopped around the grass and near the foot of the narrator and the narrator suspected that an injured dragonfly had hopped around the grass and near the foot of the narrator.  

The narrator found the wood frog and began to be surprised because she found it.  

The narrator grabbed the wood frog.  

The narrator ran into a house.  

The narrator filled a tank with a group of rocks including some big second rock.  

The narrator partially filled the tank with some water.  

The narrator set the wood frog into the tank.  

The wood frog sat motionlessly on the second rock.  

The wood frog realized the water.  

The wood frog scurried into the water.  

The wood frog floated.  

A cat realized the wood frog.  

The cat meowed repeatedly.  

The narrator wanted to keep the wood frog because -- if it were to begin to snow -- the wood frog would have begun to die.  

A woman reminded the narrator that -- if the wood frog were to not reunite with a group of friends of the wood frog -- it would begin to be lonely.  

The narrator agreed.  

The narrator freed the wood frog in a flower garden.  

The narrator forced the woman to avow that -- if the narrator were to later find a second wood frog -- the woman would allow the narrator to keep the wood frog.  

The narrator wanted to help a second wood frog.
