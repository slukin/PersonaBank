A young man long ago crashed the motorbike of the man on the front yard of a narrator and broke the neck of the man.  

The narrator stayed with the man and didn't aid him because the man had broken the neck of the man.  

The man died on the spot of the yard of the narrator.  

The narrator later went back to the spot of the yard of the narrator and decided to talk to the man because it wanted the man to know the narrator regretting that it had not aided him.  

The narrator saw some bright flash in a group of trees that was above the narrator.  

The narrator logically thought for the brother of the narrator to use the flashlight of the brother of the narrator.  

The narrator entered the house of the narrator and heard that the asleep family of the narrator was asleep.  

The narrator began to wonder that the flash was an orb.
