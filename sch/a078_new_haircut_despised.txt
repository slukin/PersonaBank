There once was a narrator.  The narrator was wanting a hair that was more short than the thick hair of the narrator.  

The narrator spontaneously visited a hairstylist in order for the hairstylist to cut the hair of the narrator.  

The narrator rummaged a magazine for a hair because she was unprepared.  

The narrator found a hair and told the hairstylist that the narrator was wanting it.  

The hairstylist wetted the hair of the narrator, and the hair of the narrator began to be wet.  

The hairstylist cut the hair of the narrator.  

The narrator thought that the hair of the narrator was fine.  

The hair of the narrator dried and stopped being wet.  

The narrator thought that the hair of the narrator was extremely wrong and realized that -- if the hair of the narrator is short -- it would be fluffy because it was thick.  

The narrator thought that she was unattractive.  

The narrator began to be very upset.
