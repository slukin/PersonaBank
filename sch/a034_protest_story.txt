There once was a group of leaders.  The group of leaders was meeting in order to talk about running a group of countries and near a workplace.  

A group of peoples protested because the group of leaders was meeting and began to be peaceful.  

A group of peoples stopped being peaceful, began to be riotous, burned a group of police cars and a group of peoples pelted a group of police officers.  

A group of police officers wore some armor because a group of peoples was riotous.  

A group of police officers attacked a group of peoples with a tear gas and with a group of riot guns, and a group of peoples smashed a group of windows of a group of stores.
