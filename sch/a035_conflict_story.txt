There once was a big company and a division.  The company was employing the division.  

The division hired a director.  

The director talked to the company.  

The company required for the division to sign a document.  

The director told the division that the company had required for the division to sign the document and told the division to be expedient.  

The division signed the document and returned it to the director.  

The director later said that he had read the document.  

A narrator began to be angry because the director was tardy.  

The narrator approached the director and said that -- if the director were to later say that a thing was urgent -- the narrator would need a thing to be urgent.  

The narrator said that the director was frivolous.  

The narrator ordered the director to not be frivolous.  

The director agreed meekly.  

The division fired the director.
