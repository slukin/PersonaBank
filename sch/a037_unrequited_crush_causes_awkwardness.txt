There once was a narrator.  The narrator was planning that she was promiscuous.  

The narrator began to want to date a boy.  

The narrator thought that the boy wanted to date the narrator.  

A friend of the narrator told the narrator that the narrator was a friend of the boy.  

The narrator noticed that the boy was telling a friend of the boy who owned a room a secret of the boy, is frequently in the room and is nervous because he was near her.  

The narrator began to believe that the boy wants to date the friend of the boy.  

The narrator questioned the boy.  

The boy said that he believed that the friend of the boy was pretty.  

The narrator began to believe that she was obligated to not date the boy.  

The boy asked the narrator whether wants to date a someone.  

The narrator didn't say whether wants to date a someone.  

The boy guessed that the narrator wants to date the boy.  

The narrator didn't confirm the boy.  

The narrator began to be very confused.  

The narrator e-mailed the boy in order to tell him that she wanted to date the boy and because -- if she were to later speak to the boy -- she would begin to be extremely nervous.  

The boy didn't e-mail the narrator and began to be strange.  

The narrator worried that the boy didn't want to date the narrator.
