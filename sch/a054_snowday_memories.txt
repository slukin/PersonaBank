A narrator who owned a home wanted to snow in order to not go back to a school and because -- if it were to later snow, and the school were to later begin to be cancelled -- the narrator would eat some snow and would make the snow into an ice cream, and the brother of the narrator and the narrator would sled.  

The narrator began to be an adult.  

It snowed.  

The narrator stayed in the home because it had snowed.  

The narrator drank some cocoa, ate a group of treats and she watched the snow.  

The narrator thought that -- if it were to later snow -- she would not allow a group of children of the narrator to make the snow into the ice cream and would allow the group of children of the narrator to sled.
