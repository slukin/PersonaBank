What happened today... yeah, I had to put it down somewhere to remember this. Basically, Jane reversed her car and bumped into the car behind us. We drove away because I checked and there wasnt anything there. I thought 'maybe we hit something else.' Then we went to Chevron and she checked. There was a tiny scratch. I didnt notice because her car isn't exactly new. But yeah, theres a scratch. So she GOES 'DUDE lets color it IN with markers!' So then she actually goes in her car and pulls out a red marker and starts coloring. Okay it doesnt sound as funny on here, but if you were there, it was freaking hilarous. It looked like she was psycho cloring a car... with Crayola markers. Anyways, it worked haha then we went to barcode. The end. Oh and the guy that was casher-ing us was pretty cute. He looked familiar.
