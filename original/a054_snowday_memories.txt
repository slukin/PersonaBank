Dear gentle readers,  I'm stuck inside for nearly the second day in a row due to snow. Lots and lots of snow. According to news reports, about a foot of snow was dumped onto roadways and streets in town yesterday.  Thank goodness I'm drinking some hot cocoa and nibbling on some sugar-free chocolate chip Girl Scout cookies while watching this stuff.  When I was a child, I yearned for snow days to escape the humdrum and loneliness of school. Whenever school was canceled, my brother and I got out our sledding circles (I was too big for those normal-sized sleds, so we got those large plastic disks instead) and launched ourselves into a sledding frenzy for a good hour or so. I used to grab handfuls of glistening white snow and eat it straight up, sometimes hauling a bucket or two inside to make snow ice cream with milk and sugar before it turned into slush.  Today, I probably wouldn't allow my kids to make snow ice cream, afraid that the atmospheric toxins would damage their immune systems. I may let them, however, still go sledding around the neighborhood, taking them away temporarily from the PlayStation and the TV. Kids still need inventive play outside, even in the snow.  Later, folks.
