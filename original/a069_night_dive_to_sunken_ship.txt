so this night dive was amzing, we drove down to the beach wich was 30mins away, got our gear and set out on the boat, nothing to see at all. we got in the water, and finally i didnt have to think about anyone anymore, just what i would see in this world of beauty. we dove down it was really dark so we had to stay together, we went down about 20ms to a wreck boat which just totally blew my mind. there was 3 parts in total, the front the back and the middle which was in between the two parts just upside down, dont ask how though. we went in through every part every room and just made my week. after that we swam around it and i saw sharks, which was scary but great. pretty friendly little fuckers, just dont do any sudden moves around them. then we dove down a little more and saw an electric eel which seemed like 10ft long but things underwater seem bigger since light doesnt travel as fast. after that swam around a small coral reef and saw a big lobster with a school of fish passing by, i wish we could have stayed longer but time was of the essence came back up took of our gear cleaned it and now im home exhausted. it was worth it though.   well since now its out there and i know this wont be talked about, well, what now?   mhm answer me if you can. i have to go take this salt water off me
