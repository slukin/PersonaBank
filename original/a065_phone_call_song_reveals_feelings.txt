Today I realized how much I actually love her, and no not that crazy chick that I finally got rid of.  I was talking on the phone with her and we had run out of things to talk about so I had started singing Lips of an Angel. She'd occasionally sing along but I don't think she was paying much attention to it. But the whole damn song I was picturing her. The lyrics just kept screaming out at me. I mean, not how the song was intended. Its really about two people breaking up and the girl calling up her ex and they're talking about how they still have feelings for each other. But the way I took it in was how her boyfriend doesn't like us talking but she kept talking to me anyways and all these stupid feelings I have for her. I don't even know. I'm just an idiot, I guess.  But it gotten to the point I started crying. I didn't let her know that because I already made things awkward enough in the past and I didn't want to bring it up again.  Because she only looks at me as a friend and as much as it kills me...thats all we'll ever be.
