 my most recent strangely happy moment. I was in a car accident the other day. Sort of. Heheh. I was heading to Jane#'s B-day party (mixed with her brothers, they're all born in the same month) and this girl Anne hits me when I'm about to hit the stoplight coming off an exit. I get out of my car, she's spazzing. I checked my bumper where she hit me. Scraped up. She's *SPAZZING*. I see her license plate frame broke off, picked it up and handed it to her. She's spazzing still asking if we should trade information, if I'm okay, apologizing... so what else could I do? I gave her a hug and told her it was okay. She spazzed less. It made me indescribably happy. Not the accident but the easing of her spazzing. The hug really did wonders. It was cool that I knew her too. She works at this 'the edge' kiosk in the trumbull and Milford malls. She's a cutey. Just a random happy moment for me. Getting hit by another car. Grins* ~le poof~
