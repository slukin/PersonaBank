There's a woman in one f my classes who I am very attracted to. Lucky for me, she offered to give me a ride home every week. Last week she drove me and another student home, but the other guy has a car now I guess, so it was just me and her. She sort of walked right up next to me so our arms were touching as we were walking to her car. But I didn't make a move then, and right before she dropped me off at my house she mentioned she has a boyfriend, so I didn't make a move on her. Does this mean I had my chance and missed it, or that I said something stupid in the car and she isn't attracted to me any more? There was nothing awkward about our goodbye, I just didn't make a move because she mentioned her boyfriend. Or do you think she still wants to hook up, and she just mentioned her boyfriend to let me know that it will only be sexual, and she is not looking to get involved in a relationship with me?
