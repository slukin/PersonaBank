I got a haircut yesterday and I hate hate HATE it! I kind of got it done on impulse (i mean I needed it done anyway) so I wasn't prepared with photos or anything and I had to flip through a magazine looking for what i wanted.   I wanted a short version of this basically. Like where the top layer curled into my chin. I found similar enough haircuts in a magazine and told her what I wanted.  It looked fine wet but it dried completely wrong. She cut it way too short in the front and its basically a shorter version of what I just had WHICH IS NOT WHAT I WANTED. Because my hair is f****** THICK so short hair is f****** POOFY.  And I dunno I just think I look really stupid now. It's just completely wrong and I had her layer the back, which by the way, she didn't even do that right.  Just uuuuuugh I should have just gotten my bangs trimmed or something and idk I want to cry now.   And I'm not even depressed about that. Just being on campus for a week has made me feel so f****** shitty. Like shittier than I felt shut up in my room all summer.    ps I realized I'm scared to wear lolita on campus now. awesome y/y :|
