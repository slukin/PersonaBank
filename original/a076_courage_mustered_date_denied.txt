So I finally mustered the courage to ask a girl out. She is awesome; articulate, bright, sweet and funny. Why did I hesitate? I guess I was a little intimidated. Didn't know how she would respond. Honestly, men experience the same butterflies. I also know I'm not exactly the perfect 'black chick' type (a black guy! lol), so it was all the more daunting. Initially I began with a little small talk...... I could tell she wasn't interested. Then I did it. I asked her to coffee. She cracked a smile, as if thinkng about something and then politely declined. Now I remembered why I don't ask girls out as often as I should. It was sooo embarrasing. But! Do you know what she said? She told me she would have, if she didn't have a boyfriend. So thaaaaat's why. Bummer. Maybe I had a chance afterall. Who knows? Maybe she lied? I actually saw the guy weeks after I initially asked her out. Yup, I finally realized I didn't have a chance in hell with her. Life sucks. Any advice? I really want her.
