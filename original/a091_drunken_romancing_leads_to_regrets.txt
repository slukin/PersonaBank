So I'm posting in the Chi-town CL because I know that anyone I speak of in this rant will never find it.  I got completely trashed for my birthday and asked one of my friends out but he of course didn't take me seriously because I was drunk. I thought he wasn't taking me seriously because he didn't like me. After this conversation with him, I bluntly TOLD another one of my friends that they were my boyfriend and that was that.  Tonight I found out that my new boyfriend got two phone calls from two of his ex's and both of which told him that they thought they were pregnant by him. It's not official, but there's a strong possibility. So not only do I have to deal with the baby momma drama with one chick, but now it's two?  Tonight, I ALSO found out that the guy I had actually ASKED out really did like me and I didn't want to lie to my boyfriend so I told him. Then my boyfriend proceeded to flip out on me by yelling at me and calling me a liar. He said I lied about what I said to him the other day which was that I was falling for him and I liked him a lot and I cared about him a lot.  My friend feels terrible because he thinks he caused these problems between my boyfriend and I, but he didn't. This is obviously one of those times I should have kept my mouth shut.  /endrant.
