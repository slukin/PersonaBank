I had a dream last night, or perhaps this morning, since I kept waking up to my alarm and resetting it for a few minutes more sleep. I was running through a field of grass, carrying an armful of what I think were papers. I was running away. I was fed up with something. Grieved. Sad. I cried as I ran. I tossed the papers all away from me and ran faster. But as I ran like this, my crying turned into quiet laughter. Then I ran faster still, and my laughing got louder. Finally, I was running so fast, faster than I had ever run in my life, and laughing so hard, harder than I had ever laughed, that I tumbled into the grass onto my back. I stared up into the clear sky and laughed until my sides were sore. Then I breathed a long, happy sigh and continued to look into the sky. That was it.
