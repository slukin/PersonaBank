Well, I decided to name the bunny Devi. Boy, she's a nibbler! I think she's still getting used to us, but I was glad to notice her eating and drinking (we didn't see her eat her pellets or drink from her bottle last night, though she did take a chunk out of her treat). I got her an igloo to hide in, in case we get to be too much for her at times. She seems to like it. I'll have to get video of it sometime, but John## just loves petting Devi. He, also, likes looking at her through the cage, as long as we let him stand there and touch the cage. One of us will lay down with Devi on our chest, and John## will sit on our stomach behind her and pet her. He gets so excited and laughs a lot. We do have to keep an eye on him because he likes to try to pick her up or grab her ears sometimes. We're still trying to teach him to be gentle. He does pretty well with it most of the time. Not much else going on.
