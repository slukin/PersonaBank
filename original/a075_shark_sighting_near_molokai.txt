We gazed up at the sky swimming above us; our flippers hovering in the warm Hawaiian ocean. Fish flickered below the surface, plummeting off the coral like ribbons. Surges of water rocked against the boat spraying drops of water across our tan legs. Georgia looked over at me adjusting her snorkel.  'Ready?' I asked her pulling my t-shirt over my head.  'Ready,' My sister echoed.  We hoisted ourselves off the platform. Head first I pumped along the surface, a stream of blue bubbles swam at my heels. A giant coral stretched across the dormant volcano, Molokai, crabs creeping in and out of it. To my left a thick forest of reeds glistened with tortoises basking across its surface. I blew through my snorkel and descended downwards; a school of fish raced by my goggles. Through the bubbles they created something silver flicked behind school of fish. My ears began to pound as my lungs drained. I glanced up at the surface, rays of white beaming from it. As I beat my arms pushing upward the silver fish brushed the bottom of my feet. At the surface I took a quick breath and dumped the salty water from my snorkel before plunging my face back under the water, hoping for a better glimpse of the large fish.  'Oh god,' I swallowed the words and the water as the silver and white shark slithered into the reeds.
