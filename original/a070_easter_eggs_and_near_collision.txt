I decided the Easter bunny can stay. The Easter chicken needs someone to deliver the baskets. Laying all those eggs has to be tiresome. Easter was a lot of fun this year. Sat. we colored and hid eggs with some cousins. One of my eggs was yellow with a smiley face made by using a white crayon before dying. On my other egg I used a yellow crayon and drew a chick and flower on it then dyed it in blue. It was very pretty. I will have to remember to experiment with different colors next year.I helped my dad hide the eggs. I tried to be creative. I hid one egg under my Grandmother's plastic chicken. No one found it till I gave Bob a clue. I thought it was funny. Sunday I got a bag full of treats since Jake and I are too old for the baskets themselves. We then went to church. It was very crowded but nice. Jake and I almost ended up in a 5 car pile up on the way over. Someone with an ATV trailer had suddenly stopped to turn off onto a trail head. They didn't give a warning so us and the 3 cars ahead of us had very little time to stop. Several cars ended up swerving but no one got hit.
