I was outside with my two youngest, when I looked down by my feet and saw a frog next to my foot. The girls came running over to see it and the next thing I knew we were crouching in the grass, watching it make a slow trek across the yard in the fading light. We all thought it was headed towards the pond, where the frogs have been laying eggs like gangbusters the last week. At the last minute she faked us out, hopping underneath our porch instead. We all hopped on the trampoline like frogs until it was really, truly dark outside.
