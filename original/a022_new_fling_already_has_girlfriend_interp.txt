I met this boy Sunday and we hung out all day and did a lot of flirting! Then we started texting and were texting for like 72 hours straight saying flirty things and having fun messing with each other. I fell for him the second I saw him, and then when I got to know him I was head over heals! Then I found out he had he had a girl friend the whole time! He never told me! I don't know how to cope, I don't know what to do at all! How could he have lead me on like that? I was so hurt. And I just felt like an idiot! I know I need to tell him but I cant. And I really want to stay friends with him and maybe it will lead to something else! But I dont know if I can trust him! Im so lost and I need advice, or help or any kind words of encouragement!
