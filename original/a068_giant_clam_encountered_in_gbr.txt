today I went scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef....AWESOME doesn't even begin to describe it.  Not gonna lie, when we first jumped into the water and I started breathing through the mouthpiece, I thought I was going to panic and not be able to do it because it was just that weird. After getting a couple of meters down into the water, I adjusted and was able to focus on the reef instead of how I was breathing.  It's hands down one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Scuba diving in and of itself is a cool experience, but throwing in the reef just made it all that more special. I touched a GIANT clam and it opened and closed as I sort of petted it...there was this weird plant that changed colours when you touched it...it's just a wonderful and exotic place with so much activity.  Some people on my boat after my first dive said they had seen a shark...uh...that may have changed things for me. Because I myself HADN'T seen a shark, I was able to convince myself to do my second afternoon dive.  On the boat ride back to Cairns, we also saw a group of whales. Aaah, such majestic creatures.  I'm sad I only have less than a week left to explore Australia, there's so much more I could do here if I only had time!
