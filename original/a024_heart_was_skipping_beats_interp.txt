The scariest thing happened to me this morning. I was all ready to go to school &amp; eating my breakfast when I got this really weird feeling and it felt like my heart was skipping beats. I couldn't move or anything, like my whole body was paralyzed. Then it hurt so bad. I started freaking out to the point where I wanted to go to the hospital. Atfirst I thought it was just a panic attack but then I was like, uhh that''s never happened when im having one before. So I stayed home and went to the doctors at 10. Ive been through this before but it just felt like my heart skipped; it never hurt. So I got blood taken and an EKG. On the 26th I have to go Dupont to get a echo cardiogram and wear a holter monitor for a few days or so. Ive done it before so its no big deal.
