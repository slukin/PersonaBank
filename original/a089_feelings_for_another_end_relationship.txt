i've been going out with this guy for almost 2years and i really do love him. he's the sweetest guy i've ever meet. but the thing is in 7th grade i'm in 10th know. but in 7th grade i really liked this guy and he liked me but that spark never left, and i look at him everytime he walks by. i'm not sure if he like's me i don't think he does. but i told my boyfriend this because it's not right to like another guy and have a boyfriend. but the thing is i don't want to like the other guy i just can't help it. i think it's an old spark. so i broke up with my boyfriend because i didn't want to put him through this. and he cryed he's like i love you with all my heart and always will. and the last thing he said to me was good bye and i love you. when we did brake up i called him and talked to him; he actually talked to me. and later that day he called me to talk. and he said "why are we even talking what does it mean". and i don't know what to do. i don't know what i want. but my boyfriend and i were already drifting. like for example yesterday was the first time i kissed him in a long time... i like the other guy but i don't want to.and i told my boyfriend this and he said " i think your mind doesnt' want to like him but you heart does." the guy looks at me back but i think it's cuz i look at him. thanks for reading:) please anwser.
