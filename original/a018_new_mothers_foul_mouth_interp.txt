Before I had children, I worried about my incredibly foul mouth. Would my kids start cursing like little toddling sailors? This was a bit silly given that my family cursed like mad when I was a kid, but I did not, because I knew I would get in trouble, so it's clearly possible. On the other hand, my sister was nearly expelled from Quaker pre-school for calling someone a shithead at age 2. But then I realized that I could control my cursing if I were in some professional situation, or eating with my wonderful in-laws, or what have you, and I just had to transfer that attitude to my kids. I was justly proud when I dropped a big bottle of soda on my bare foot in the elevator at Gillman and shouted 'Oh, crumbles!!!' But I knew yesterday that I had really done a better job than I imagined: Our (stray, semi-adopted) cat took a dump right on my bed yesterday because it was 40 and we had been out of cat food all day. I groaned and when Ann asked why I said 'Hissfahan shit on the bed', and she said 'what's shit?'
