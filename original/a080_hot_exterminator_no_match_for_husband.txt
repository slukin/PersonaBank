First let me start by saying, I love my husband. I really, really do. If I didn't wouldn't I have married him and I wouldn't want to start a family with him and grow old together and all that good mushy stuff.  .....That however doesn't mean I don't occasionally look at the random hot guy or girl, yep, I'm like that, but today the gentleman who is going to be doing our pest control came in and I just happened to working downstairs and watching the office for the admin who was out. Oh heavens above this man is hot and then he opens his mouth and speaks and he's got this good ol boy country twang which I grew up with and before I met my husband this is the type of guy I dated. Only the guys I went out with were never this hot. Man, this man is hot and he's one of those guys who doesn't know he's hot, he's just an everyday, regular kind of guy, which makes him even hotter.  Wow. Yeah, he was hot. Then I came home and John# had dinner ready and it was incredibly good and I thought, yeah, the bug guy is hot, but I'd never give up what I've got now with John# for one night with him. Sometimes love does conquer all.  Anne#
