Due to the extremely mild weather on Monday, my parents decided that they should open the windows to air out the house. This was a problem, however, because our kitchen windows do not have screens, which, consequently, allows outside creatures to enter. Needless to say, Tuesday morning, my mom found a bird frantically flying around the kitchen (where this bird was hiding all night is still a mystery). However, my dad was able to guide the bird toward the door and shortly thereafter, the bird flew back into the wild...or so we thought. Tuesday night we come home from dinner, and no sooner had I walked in the house and turned on the light, I saw a bird fly into our Christmas tree. There had not been just 1 bird, but 2 that had entered the house, and unfortunately, the friend of bird 1 had not been lucky enough to escape earlier in the day and passed the time by nestling atop our 10 foot Christmas tree. It took us forever to rid ourselves of this creature...the stupid thing kept regressing back to the highest part of our tree, which of course was unreachable. Finally, after disassembling ths tree and devoting almost 2 hours of our night, bird 2 was gone. Thank goodness. It had been a VERY long day, and between my dad constructing a homemade net to "catch" the bird, my mom laughing, and my desperate desire to go to bed, I was seriously about 5 seconds away from totally flipping out. You should have been there.
