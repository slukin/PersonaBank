Ok, I never noticed this but like 3 weeks ago my dad bought this powdered chocolate that you put into a drink (he and I put it with ice and fruits for a smoothie instead) and what he says 'makes your muscles bigger' I didnt believe him and I dont think anything that is legal could make your muscles bigger cause when I read the bottle it said all this scientific nosense that I had no clue about. Well, ive been taking the poweder (in a smoothie of course) for about 2 weeks now and while im not buldging huge ive noticed I have grown reasonably bigger in my chest and arms areas (biceps and triceps). But then again I do workout almost every other day (its not that often) He said take the drink every day and only 1 scoop of powder per day or youll get kidney problems with more than one scoop. Also: This is a serious topic, if your willing to help and answer my question please post. And be honest.
