I have two cats. I always felt like I was a dog person, but we decided to get a kitty because they are more low maintenance than dogs.  We went to a no-kill shelter to get our first cat. I wanted a little kitty, but the only baby kitten they had scratched the crap out of me the minute I picked it up. SO, that was a big "NO". They had what they called "teenagers". They were cats that were 4-6 months old. Not adults, but a little bigger than the little kittens. One stood out - mostly because she jumped up on a shelf behind my husband and smacked him in the head with her paw. We had a winner!  I had no idea how much personality a cat can have. Our first kitty loves to play. She will play until she is out of breath. Then, she looks at you as if to say, "Just give me a minute, I'll get my breath back and be good to go." Sometimes I wish I had that much enthusiasm for anything in my life. She loves to chase a string. It's the best thing ever. Ok, maybe it runs a close second to hair scrunchies. We play fetch with my hair scrunchies. I throw them down the stairs and she runs (top speed) to get them and bring them back. Again, she will do this until she is out of breath.  If only I could work out that hard...I'd probably be thinner.
