I am new here so I dont know if this has been posted but me and my father bought iPhone 3G's then two weeks later he went swimming with his. So he wanted to get another one but didnt want to pay the $400. So we went to at&t and we told them what happened and they said with an iPhone you are always eligable for an upgrade and you can get a new iPhone at the same price but you just have to restart your 2yr agreement. Since we only had the phones for 2weeks restarting the 2yrs was nothing. So we went to the apple store and told them we had water damage they said we need a new phone. So we went like we were getting a phone and we got a new phone for the same 199 and restarted our contract. Then sold the water damged one for 400 on ebay.
