Jane# and I went camping Friday evening, and so many factors converged into a perfect storm of bliss: low humidity, no chance of rain, a multiple-mile hike to our chosen campsite through some of the best woods Indiana has to offer (without encountering another living human on the entire hike), no bugs, an amazing dog to help carry water and watch for critters, and just enough dry wood to make just enough fire to cuddle by before the sun was completely gone and then just enough moonlight to not trip over each other to walk to our tent-free bedding.  Yes.  It's just what I'd been hoping for.  The rest of the weekend was full of other bliss-inducing stuff, and when I drove home last night, I was wearing a permagrin.  This morning, I ebayed a decent tent for the kids and myself (we'd borrowed Jane#'s for Cali). The boys and I have some camping planned during 2 of their next five weekends with me.  My short-lived hylophobia is just that... short-lived. :D
