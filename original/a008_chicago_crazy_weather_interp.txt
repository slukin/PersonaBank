We've seriously had some crazy weather these past couple of days... it was nonstop rain, and more rain! Supposedly yesterday was the rainiest day in recorded Chicago history. We got a tiny amount of water in our basement, which is nothing compared to what most people are dealing with. The rain finally let up early this afternoon, and John and I went driving around and were stunned by all the flooding in our neighborhood. I've never seen anything like it! We tried to go see a movie, but couldn't get to the movie theatre because all the surrounding roads were flooded and closed off. At one point we saw about 25 deer in a clearing near a forest preserve, and I saw a bunch more deer down the road. When I looked into the forest, I could see how flooded and murky it was. The poor deer have nowhere to go! I feel so bad for them. John would not let me bring any of them home with us... yes, I wanted to. My dad told me that coyotes are traveling around the city in packs in broad daylight, looking for food, so watch out! This is complete craziness.
