Today I was fingerprinting a guy who was to register as a drug offender. As I was fingerprinting him, he asked me why I smelled so good.  I told him I didn't. I told him that I sprayed my uniform with girly perfume to cover up the fact that I had not washed it in 2 1/2 weeks.  He told me he liked the way I smelled. Then he asked me out.  I politely said no.  He asked if it was because he is a convicted felon.  I politely said no (although thats definetly part of it). I explained that I have a boyfriend. Not just any boyfriend. A boyfriend who's mother works for the department as well.  He then told me to tell Jake# he is a "hater." Hey Jake#, hear that? I'm supposed to tell you that you are a 'hater.'  He then told me that he would check back from time to time until I became single.  Ewwwwww. Thanks...kinda...but no.
