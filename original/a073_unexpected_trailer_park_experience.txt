I used to occasionally hit up this biker bar on my way home from work. I didn?t really fit in at all, but I liked to 'people watch' from time to time. I stopped in one night and although I could very well have gotten my ass kicked, I didn't, and I walked away with this story to tell.  It was your typical biker bar. Lots of guys wearing leather vests, getting into fights occasionally, drinking Bud and doing shots of Jack. I don?t even remember how this came about, but I ended up picking up a chick one night who lived across the street in the trailer park. She convinced me to bring her home and I parked in front of her trailer. We sat on her picnic table for a little while and were all over each other. She finally invited me inside and I thought I was good to go. As soon as we stepped through the door we were greeted by some guy who was completely naked. He just stood there looking at me and I just about shit my pants, wondering how quickly he could grab a gun which I?m sure he had. Turned out the chick was married and her husband was in the trailer waiting for her to get home. I don't think he realized he was naked, because after about 20 seconds he finally said 'oh shit, I'm as naked as a jaybird' and covered up. The girl told him I was a friend of hers and offered to bring her home. I made a quick exit and didn't go back to that bar for a while after that.
