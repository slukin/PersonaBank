I have a group of female friends, and one of the girls (we'll call her Anne#) has been dating a guy for a couple months. We went out one night and my friend (we'll call him John.. he didn't previously know any of the girls) came out with us. By the end of the night John and Anne# ended up going home together. We asked her the next day and she said they kissed, and she never told John she had a boyfriend. We all went out again the next day and we SAW them kiss, which means she defiently cheated on her boyfriend. We asked her to tell John that she had a boyfriend, but she refuses to. We think it's not really our place to tell John, but John really likes Anne#, and is getting to the point he is ready to ask her out. Do you think we should sit John down and tell him that Anne# is cheating on her boyfriend with him? Because we all realise if she is willing to cheat on her boyfriend with John, she will also be willing to cheat on John.
