50f50d36d7ee35a12fa11bb2 I know I said in my last entry that I was gonna start dating like a guy, but I started crushin on this guy. At first I thought he liked me back, but then a friend told me that he only liked me as a friend. So I started to back off, then I started noticing how he acted around this other girl. I had a pretty good feeling he liked her, for example he is almost always in her room, he tells her stuff he doesn't really tell anyone else, and he gets real twitchy around her. So naturally I asked him and he said he thought she was pretty. After hearing that I started thinkin I should really back off now. Then he asked me who I liked and I didn't want to tell him. Later he guess but I never really told him if he was right or not. I was soooo confused as to whether or not these were signs that he liked me. After seeking advice I decided to write him an email telling him I liked him (I know not the best idea.) When I look him in the eyes I get extremely nervous and I start to back out so I figured I could be brave in an email. I emailed him last night but havent got a response yet and now he's acting really strange. Now I beginning to think I made a MAJOR mistake and fucked up any chance I coulda had with him. I know before he told me who he thought I liked that he didn't really want to say because he didn't want there to be any awkwardness. I guess it's too late for that huh?
