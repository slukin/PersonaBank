I first saw my wife in the AAFES (Army & air Force exchange service) Snack bar, more than 30 years ago. She was with an army buddy so-so friend of mine I'll call him love Boat's Capt. John### and his Korean wife Mrs John### . It seems the future Mrs Bob###### (I'll call her Ann) was best-friends with his wife (the Korean version of Mrs John###). Well, like my uncle Bob would do, I just walked right over there, said hi, and I sat right smack down at their table. Why was I so bold? The answer is easy. My future wife (Ann) was beautiful! Within about 1 minute I had offered her everything and anything in the snackbar, including salt & pepper shakers, silverware, tables and chairs. She thought I was either a cute nut or just nuts. I was in love. It was love at first sight and I was like an Ernest t. Bass from the Andy Griffith Show. I soo felt like, 'I gotta get a date with that beautiful girl'! We said goodbye and I drooled my way back to the barracks.
