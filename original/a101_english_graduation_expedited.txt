51044d82d7ee9f14f1ec254f ######, #### and ####  by ~ ########  on  deviant  ART    And an update on my life:  I am now officially graduated with English. "Wutt?" you think. Yes. It's true. Last year I gave a little self-written piece about my GN to my teacher Jane##. She gave it to an English teacher who is also a fan of Buffy. That teacher really liked my story and thought my English was really good. Then when this year started I got Gitta for English. This morning I asked her if she was the teacher who Jane## showed me story to. She said she was, and she was surprised that I was the one that wrote it. (I also mentioned that in my essay about my life. It was homework, and I wrote 3 pages.) She then said that she loved that little piece that I wrote. Then she told me that I don't have to come to her classes anymore, because my English is way above school max. She suggested I'd better work on something I'm less good at then learn English that I already know. I mean, for Peet's sake, we were learning how to use  where, were  and  we're  and  to  and  too . As you all notice: I'm pretty good at that. XDD After she told me that she also told me that for the rest of the year I'm gonna be getting G's for everything. G means good. There's O for onvoldoende(bad), V for voldoende(acceptable) and G for goed(good). She said she could give me V's for everything, but because that'd be unfair I'm getting G's. She also told me that before this schoolyear started Jane## had told her that she, Gitta, was going to be teaching me English. I'm so glad I don't have to have English this year. I was bored as hell those 50minutes in class, and I was giving all the answers, and no one learns that way. So I'll just hide in the cafateria and do Calculus or something. XD
