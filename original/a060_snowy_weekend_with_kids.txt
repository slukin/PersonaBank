I hope everyone survived the snow!  With the early school dismissal on Friday, it felt like a 3 day weekend. With the kids indoors for most of it, it felt like a 7 day weekend. My kids are just not creatures of Winter.  I did manage to take them and some of the neighborhood kids out sledding on Friday and Saturday. That was a blast. Friday, because it was in the teeth of the storm, and I just could not pass that up. The kids were shivering in the shelter after 10 minutes while I was howling at the storm (literally) and sledding myself.  Saturday was nicer, once the snow let up, and we tried again. The hill that had us and 6 people Friday, now had at least 120 (I stopped counting at 100, with more coming in). The kids had more fun, and I had a fire in the shelter with a bag of marshmallows and just enjoying myself. Followed up, of course, with hot chocolate at home. Everyone sugared-up but happy.  I even managed to cook cornbread from scratch, in an old (my grandmothers) cast-iron skillet, with chicken and gravy for dinner. If I had any collard greens, I think I would have cooked them too (just to annoy the kids). It was the first time I made cornbread that way. Usually it is from full or partial mixes. I surprised myself when I found that I had both baking power and baking soda on hand.  When the hell did I buy those???  Sunday was slow.  I racked some mead and then it was pretty much the kids with computer and Gameboy games all day.  I am going to try tonight to make another batch of mead, raspberry (I found a gallon of puree in the basement). Less than 5 months until Starwood, so I don't know if it will be ready on time. The other stuff will be, but that only gives me about 3 gallons.
