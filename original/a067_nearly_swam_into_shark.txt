Holy shit. On our dive today, I almost swam headfirst into a black tip shark bigger than me. I don't even OWN brown swim trunks.  I was just trucking along about 20 feet down, swam over the top of a coral head and there he was, swimming right at me. I just kinda stopped swimming, wondering what to do - as the slight current and my momentum swept me closer to him. Luckily, the reef sharks are not aggressive, and he turned and swam in the other direction. Trix1e and I saw seven more during the dive, and it was kinda creepy when they just swam past us. The barracuda down here are big and ugly, too.  The coolest thing we saw was a huge eagle ray swimming along. The water was much clearer today, and I was far more happy than I was on Monday's dive.  There were a couple of ocean researchers diving with us, doing measurements and fish counts. I chatted with them a little on the boat, and although most people assume that much of the problems with reef systems are due to global warming, these guys were telling me that warm water may cause bleaching, but it is THE SEPTIC SYSTEMS here in the Keys causing much of the disease found on the coral. They have even demonstrably proven that certain bacteria is behind it and they are pursuing legislation that has been passing in Florida and elsewhere.  At least it's good to know that God is not killing the reefs because he hates gays...
