Ok so I was leaving Walmart... fun fun! Guess who drives by me?? Hmm any takers?? No?? Fine... my ex. My heart jumped then I turned the car around and went back into Walmart. Yes I'm a freak, yes I guess you could say I'm a stalker... But I just wanted to see his reaction when he saw me. I don't know why... I wanted to tell him off in the worst way. I just wanted to do something. In the end... I just played it cool, talked to him for like. 2 Seconds, and then left. Now? I wish I never did that. Because really, now I am still left with everything I wish I had the guts to say. Now I wish I had balls enough to truly tell him off and let him know what a complete piece of shit he really is... but in the end... I guess I know I'm better than that, in fact better than him. If I hadn't said it before, I will say it now... He's a loser! But really, even knowing that... doesn't make it much easier!
