For easter I did a ton of fun stuff. On Friday I had a sleep over with my cousins. We stayed up until like 2 in the morning. We had a great time playing and laughing.  Then on Saturday my grandma had an Easter egg hunt. She had three different rounds for the different age levels. We each pulled a color out of a hat and then had to find that color in her yard. There was money and candy in the eggs. It was so fun. My aunts, uncles, and cousins who were in other rounds hid the eggs for the other people to find. When I hid eggs I buried them in the dirt and hid them in tubes and under rocks. They had a really hard time finding them. After the hunt we had a barbecue with amazing food. After that we played softball and went to the park. I got really sunburned and hurt my wrist but other than that it was a lot of fun. When we got home from the park we went to my uncle's hotel he stayed in and swam in the pool. It was fun. We threw a football around and played games. But mostly talked and laughed. When we were done swimming we went to my aunt's house to color eggs. We spilled a bit but it was fun. When we were done with that we went back to my house. Some of my cousins slept over and we stayed up really late again. In the morning we ate home made waffles. Then we found the eggs the bunny hid that night. We also went through our baskets and saw what kind of candy and clothes we had gotten. I got a lot of candy and plaid shorts with an athletic shirt. Then we got ready for church. After that we had corn beef with cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be, cause it didn't look very appetizing. Well that is what I did for Easter.
