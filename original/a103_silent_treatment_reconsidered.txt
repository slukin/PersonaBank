510511a3d7ee9f14f1f2a675 I admit, I am a slient treatment girl whenever hubby pisses me off.  I don't tell him what's wrong, because I expected him to figure it out and apologize.  But he's so bad at figuring things out, so by the time he actually noticed something was wrong, I've already forgot what I was angry about to begin with.  Hubby told me to stop acting like a child and to communicate with him like an adult.  I told him I have no idea why I do what I do, but it's almost like a reflex, I can't help it!    One night while we were driving I shared a little childhood routine with him.  I was generally a good kid 20 some years ago.  However, once in a while, I would do something really bad to piss my mom off.  She didn't hit me or scold me, she just ignored me for hours until I squeezed out some tears and apologize to her for whatever i did wrong.   Mmmmm...I wonder who else does that these days.   Hubby questioned.  I all of sudden realized the root of my behavoir.  I subconciously learned it from my mom.  That's how she punished me and I turned it around and used it on my hubby.  The only problem is that my hubby is not my child and I'm not his mother.  I can't punish him!  LOL!  Now that I know why I do the silent treatment thing, maybe one day I will change.  But Ted, don't expect me to magically be your perfect wife.  :)
