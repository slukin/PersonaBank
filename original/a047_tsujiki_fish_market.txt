On Monday morning myself and Anne## headed down to Tsujiki Fish market for the early morning auction. Tsujiki is the largest fish market in Asia according to Lonely planet, maybe even the world. The market area covers several kilometres. We got there at 6.30am and missed the auction as nothing was signposted in Romanji but we weren't the only ones! We bumped into plenty of other people, many there earlier than us, and none had managed to get to see the auction itself. According to one guidebook the auction is only open to the trade.  Anyway it was still a fantastic experience to see hundreds of wholesalers ferrying their wares back and forth including some huge Tuna. The small delivery carts speed around fully loaded and I saw a few collisions so I guess it make sense to stay out of their way. The tuna had their tails cut off and stuffed into their mouths to save space in such cramped conditions. I took plenty of photos and peered into lots of boxes of marine produce many of which I'd never seen before. I watched traders scoop live fish out of water tanks onto iced displays, toss live crabs and lobsters accross stalls, Skin and prepare eels for pickling and plenty more.  After the wholesale market we wandered around the smaller peripheral market which sold everything from marine equipment to vegetables and specialist teas. There was also stalls where you could get the freshest noodles and sushi in Tokyo - straight of the boat. People were queueing to get in at 7.30am in the morning. I thought about having a sushi breakfast and then decided my tummy might not thank me for it and opted for a roadside cappucino and pastry instead.  On the way back to the subway station we went in to a beautiful buddhist temple right beside the Hibaya line entrance. It was quite different to many Japanese temples in that the 'altar' area was very elaborately decorated. It was nice to take a breather there before jumping on the subway home.
