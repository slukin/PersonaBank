We went to the conservation here in town on the 10th and we all had SUCH a good time!  John### and I even went down the hill too.  Bob## LOVED sledding and while sliding down the hill he would giggle and yell out his happiest word ?coooookie!? all the way down the hill :)      Jake## also enjoyed sledding but his favorite thing to do in the snow is to have snowball fights!!    Jake## also had fun teaching Bob## the joys of eating snow    and both boys enjoyed attacking Daddy at the bottom of the hill    Then, once Jake## was tired of walking back up the hill, he decided to help push Daddy and Bob## down for one last ride    When John### was bringing Bob## back up the hill I asked if he had fun - in true Bob## style he replied 'no' with a HUGE smile and giggle (he answers 'no' to everything lately - even if the real answer is yes), so they we asked if he wanted to go again and he said 'no' (of course) but as soon as John### put him and the sled down Bob## crawled back in, read to go again LOL  It was about time to go home and John### told me I had to go down the hill at least once (I had been running up and down the hill getting pictures of course), so Jake## offered to push me and when I was about to go down the hill, I grabbed him and pulled him along.  He was laughing the whole way, but was NOT happy when we got to the bottom and he thought he?d have to walk all the way back up. SO, since it was 'my fault' he was down there again I carried him and the sled back up? oh MY was that a work out!!  We got home and took off our coats, hats and boots - and John### snapped this cute picture of all our boots sitting on the rug to dry
