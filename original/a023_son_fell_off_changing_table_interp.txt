What one thing have you done in your life that you are you most ashamed of? When my son was 3 months old, I was changing him on his rather high changing table (that we had been given as a gift). I heard someone approaching from behind me so I turned for half a second to see who it was (my MIL). My son chose that moment to roll over for the very first time in his life, and he rolled right off the table. He landed head-first on a solid marble floor. It was so quick--I still to this day don't know how he did it. He fractured his tiny skull and had some brain bruising. I have never forgiven myself and I know I never will. Thankfully there was no lasting damage -- we went back for follow-up tests a month later and everything was back to normal in regards to his brain activity. Over two years later, he is highly advanced for his age. But that doesn't stop me from looking back at that day and wanting to die of guilt, shame, and self-hatred.
