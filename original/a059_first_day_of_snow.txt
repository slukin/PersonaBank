Every year we wait half in anticipation, half in dread for the first day of snow. For some, it signals the true start of winter, to others it marks the nearing of finals week. For me, it marks the time for boots and gloves, scarves and hats. It also marks the time for sledding, skiing, and ice skating. The first day of winter is a huge event, especially for those who are in South Dakota. It is impossible to escape the snow if you're living in SD. For me, this year I was working when it was snowing. I was so sad because I was unable to go out and play in it like I have done ever since I was a child. Fortunately work ended shortly after that and I was able to call up my friends and head to their place. Once there we bundled up in our warmest clothes that we hadn't really had a chance to use yet. Out came scarves of many different colors, hats, mittens, gloves, winter coats, and boots. Finally, we were prepared and we dove outside! It was great to play in the snow like that. It's something I've done with my friends for years and I hope to be able to continue doing. Afterwards, wet and cold and sniffly, we headed inside and warmed ourselves with Hot Chocolate. The first day of snow is a very important cultural event for this area.
