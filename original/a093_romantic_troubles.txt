OK. So last night I talked to Bob as always.  A couple days ago he was telling me how this girl was really hot and he asked her out. I asked him what happened and he said that she said yes. LIAR. Bob has an obsession with blondes. I happen to have pretty blonde friends and he always asks me to hook him up with one of them. Almost all of them have boyfriends or don't like Bob. Poor Bob. Well anyways, I said "Wait a minute I thought you were going to go out with that hot chick?" Turns out she really said no. I laughed. I questioned why he lied to me. He said because of the haha.  True I did laugh but did he really need to lie? No. He said he knew I would laugh. He knows me all to well. I told him I did get a little jealous by what he said. He said "I know you did." I said how did you know? He replied because I know you.  The real reason I won't hook any of my friends up with Bob isn't that hard to figure out. Bob knows I love him, so why would I let him go gallivanting off with one of my pretty blonde big chested friends? What's wrong with a smart funny big chested light brown haired girl who knows him better than anyone else? Nothing he's just a complete moron. It's okay it's not like I'm only wasting my time on him. I have a sort of boyfriend that Bob completely hates and doesn't trust.   Jealous much?
