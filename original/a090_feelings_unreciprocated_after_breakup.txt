So about two weeks ago I left my current ex boyfriend, who was emotionally abusive...I've been trying to leav e him for 4 years now and I finally managed to run to Brooks and come live with my sister!  So anyways I met this friend of my sisters "Mr. X" he was so sweet to me the first week and the next, he said all the right things, held me in his arms well we watched movies....  and then we went camping!!! This is were it all changed. See I started to really care about the guy and I ended up sleeping with him in our friends trailor that night BIG MISTAKE!!!  Now, don't get me wrong I'm not the type to just have one night stands I believe sex should mean something though, so for watever reason though I tried to justify to myself that after only knowing this guy for two weeks that I should sleep with him.  Well the next day I have to admit I was overly clingy, literealy begging to stay with him after all our friends went home for the night., I know patheitc ay?  Then he told me that he had tried to "feel a spark, but there was just nothing there" well that's good and all but just the week before when we were just laying in each others arms watching a movie he was caressing my stomach and he said "I'm sorry, I just can't stop touching you."  Now why the f*** would he have said that if there "wasn't anything there?"  I know, I know what your thinking "this chick over analysis waaayyyy to much" So now I'm going to stop I'll tell you more later as now I'm just trying to be Mr. X's friends
