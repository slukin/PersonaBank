Even if we're on 'vacation', potty re-learning goes on. There's not much success yet. Or must I say, no success yet. He still won't sit on the toilet and do his thing. Though he wants me to dump his poopie in the toilet, and insists that he flushes the toilet on his own. However yesterday was a different story. I was watching Nicktoons, and the little boy was hiding in the closet playing, when he bursted out crying for help. And it went like this: Mommy. Please help, with clasp hands on his chest, pleading. My almost 3yo is really funny and cute. Sometimes. I don't find him funny and cute when he pesters me. So I dashed him to the bathroom with no resistance. But as usual, it was too late. He did it on his nappy, and it was mushy, since he's back taking antibiotics (oh, not again!), which the hotel doctor prescribed him late Monday night, due to wheezing, that we can hear everytime he breaths. He hasn't pooped yet today, so we'll see if I could time it properly; meaning, poopie in the big potty.
