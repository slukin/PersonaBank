We've passed this irrigation canal, for the watering of the fields, many years and many seasons. Yesterday, the canal caught my eye in the gusty rain. The colors were deeper, saturated, and the landscape nearly a painting. An ordinary irrigation canal beautiful in the rain. Pulled off on the side, no shoulder, of a two-lane highway, windshields wipers swishing, traffic splashing by, I was able to capture what I saw. By the way, I wasn't driving this time. Dear John### managed maneuvering the truck around drop-offs and ditches, while watching the traffic, as I focused the camera and clicked with blowing rain through the window. We spent the next few hours trading driving, and snapping photos from within the truck, and truly enjoyed our rainy photographic escapade. We were amazed how the rain brought out the colors, and ordinary things were magical. Copyright (C) 2008 by #### #######. All rights Reserved. Visit our other photoblog: Abstract reflections
