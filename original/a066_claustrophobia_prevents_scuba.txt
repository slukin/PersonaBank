this weekend a group of us went on an arcadia excursion to mission beach. it was absolutely amazing! on saturday we got to take a boat out to the great barrier reef. i was so excited to try scuba diving, but seconds after going under the water, i felt claustrophobic and like i couldn't breathe. i couldn't stay under the water, so i had to go back to the boat while the others went diving, but it turned out well anyways. i got to go snorkeling instead, and even got to see a shark and a turtle (thanks to long for pointing them out)! there were so many fish with every possible size shape and color imaginable. it looked just like finding nemo. minus the dori fish.  i bought an underwater camera and took some pictures and can't wait to develop them once i get back to the states. i saw nemo fishies, rainbow ones, long skinny ones that we think were barracudas, sea anemones, lots and lots of coral, and the most amazingly blue water i've ever seen. it was so gorgeous! some of the people in our group even saw dolphins too swimming alongside the boat. the reef was definitely one of the most incredible things i've ever seen. on sunday we headed out to the rainforest where we went on a tour. our guide was this wonderfully kind woman named denise who talked about all the different kinds of plants and how the aboriginal people used them. we saw huge fan palms, which the indigenous people used in their roofs, hooks they used for fishing, and resilient vines they used for various purposes (including water!). there was this one really interesting strangler plant, which starts as a thin vine that wraps around the base of the tree. it slowly grows upwards and outwards, eventually strangling the host tree. the host tree then rots away leaving behind an intricate weave of vine. we also got to swim in a tropical freshwater watering hole which are not usually come by.
