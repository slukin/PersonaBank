I just love making an ass of myself in public places. There's a really cute barista at the b&N cafe. I go there a lot, so he knows my name and what I usually order. I saw he was working, so I grabbed a couple magazines and headed over. All fine and good, right? Except the magazine on the top of the pile? Lansing bride. Yeah, f*** you Jane##. I realized when I set stuff down to pay, and by then there was no going back. And of course he said something. And of course my only reply was to mumble something about a friend getting married. He didn't look convinced. So, now I'm the weird chick who sits in B&N reading wedding magazines when she's not even getting married. Or, I'm the chick who 'lies' about getting married so she can hit on the baristas. Yay. Also, I really hate libertarians. They suck.
