Wow, we have a lot of snow! I'm reminding myself of The Hitchhiker's Guide... I state the obvious a lot. So, this large amount of snow ruined all my plans for the past two days... I didn't get to visit my grandparents in Etown yesterday, or go out to the farm today, or eat lunch with John#'s parents as I had originally planned. However, my time was not wasted... I got to go sledding in Cherokee park with Anne###, Jack and Bob#### (who turns out to be a nephew of Dave's that I had never met before, but happens to work with Jack). It was amazing how fast you could get down dog hill on a tiny disc with a running start. It was sleeting a bit when we went, so it was nearly impossible to keep your eyes open to avoid other sledders while going down the hill... kinda had to peek every few seconds and pray if you hit someone it wasn't a 5yr.old. I went back to the park today with Joe, #####, #####, ####, #####, ############, and some members of the ####### family, but instead of sledding I just played a bit in the snow and enjoyed some hot chocolate. I've had such a warm fuzzy feeling the past couple of days =) I missed sledding with my bro though. He left to go sledding just as my toes were falling off, so I didn't get a chance to join him. In other accomplishments this weekend, I braved the oncoming snow Fri. to make a trip to Michaels, where I found a couple of glass vases I was going to rent for $15 each priced at $8, so I bought them, triumphantly =) Also got some silk flowers to use in them that look fabulous. yay! I'm not looking forward to working tomorrow, but I guess I don't have that much more of this rotation left, so there's a hazy light at the end of the tunnel.
