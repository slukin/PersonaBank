I got pulled over this morning!! Err... Yesterday morning... On my way back to Owings Mills for my sorority retreat deal. Yeah. Totally didn't notice the cops like I usually do, and apparently flew past him doing 85. And I didn't slow down when I got to 695 (they really need to up the speed limit to 65 over there I swear), so he asked me what my excuse was. 'I don't have one Sir.' 'License and registration please.' I sit there, waiting for the ticket. He hands me everything back and says Slow down. That's way too fast. Have a good day.' '... You too officer.' Yeah. So never going over 65 on 695 ever again. Cruise control... Buddy... how you doin? Told mom and dad I was doing 70 in a 55 they said if I get a ticket, I'll more than likely not have car insurance. Gah. Either way, no more than 10 above. Doing the SPEED limit on the highways around here is dangerous man. People almost hit me like, three times on 695.
