North Carolina finally saw some snow today!  I woke up at 6:15 this morning and it was pouring down at our house.   It snowed most of the morning and we ended up with about 1 1/2'-2' of the white stuff.  Me, I DO NOT drive in this stuff.  Call me a chicken but I don't trust myself, and i really don't trust the other idiot drivers out there that could plow into me.  I especially don't like the idea of Anne## being in the car with a wintry mix falling either.  So Anne## and I stayed home today (I had brought my budgets home with me just in case), but first we had to get some playtime in.  We headed out around 8am this morning with our neighbors and their kids for some fun.  We both have yards and driveways that are downhill, and not to mention a can of baking spray to add to the fun :)  I really wasn't sure how Anne## was going to like being outside with it so cold and I thought she would be afraid of sledding.  Boy was I wrong.  We stayed outside for about an hour and she went in kicking and screaming.  Joey got to play for a little bit before he went to work which i'm sure brightened his day.  Hopefully we'll get to see more snow before the winter's over, but judging from the past couple of winters, it's unlikely.  But maybe God will surprise me :)  Make sure to check out the pics of flickr!
