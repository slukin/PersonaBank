Two years ago, my division got a new director. At the same time, we (my division) were submitting a contract to do some work for a big company. When we were awarded the contract, the new director began communicating with the organization. The contracting organization required everyone who was to work on the project to sign a contract of non-disclosure. The new director sent out an email noting the urgency of everyone signing, scanning, and formatting the signed and scanned contract into a PDF. He noted that it had to be done that very day (a Friday). I had no problem with this, as it was very important.  On Wednesday of the following week, he sent me and a few other people an email stating that he had just gotten around to looking at the contracts and needed something else. The fact that he said he must receive them by Friday but did not look at them for another 5 days infuriated me. I went directly to his office and told him that if he was going to express dire urgency, then the situation had better be urgent. I told him that he wasted my time (and everyone else's). I told him that was unacceptable and that I did not expect for that to ever happen again. He did nothing but sit in his chair and say ""Okay"". Needless to say, his general laziness and inattentiveness resulted in his quick termination.
