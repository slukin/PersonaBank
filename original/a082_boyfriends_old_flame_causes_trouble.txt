just before my boyfriend and i started dating, he had a friend and they both liked eachother and their relationship was going somewhere, but they were never ~officially~ dating. then i came along and told him that i had a huge crush on him and he basically ditched the other girl for me. he talked to her and tried to stay friends with her, but she was still really hurt, and i can totally understand why. she didn't talk to him for a pretty long time.  jump ahead about 6 months. they started talking and hanging out again. they're now pretty good friends and they talk and hang out a lot. i wouldn't have a problem with that, except for the fact that i'm not allowed to meet her. she says if she meets me 'it will make her too sad'. it's been almost a year and a half since my boyfriend and i got together, and she's still not over him at all.  i really wish i could meet her. it's not a jealousy thing, i trust my boyfriend and he always tells me when he's going to spend time with her, and i don't have a problem with it. and i don't want it to be a 'me my bf and her' thing because i'm sure that would make her uncomfortable. i'd just like to be able to tag along when my boyfriend goes out with his friends and not have to sit at home by myself because she's going to be there.  should i be suspicious? should i just get the f*** over it? am i right in wanting to meet her?
