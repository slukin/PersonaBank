So this has been a crazy trip already. We left yesterday morning; everything was on time and we made it to Houston without any problems. We spent a good chunk of time there, then boarded a flight to Miami which ultimately arrived late... well, the gate was occupied whenever our plane pulled in. So we had to wait for about 20 minutes, and were expecting that the flight to Recife would be a little delayed since there were quite a few people on our plane also going there. We were wrong. We made it to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare, after running through the airport. And the jerk lady at the gate said we couldn't board the flight because she's a big stinky turd.. Well, not really. So basically, we missed the flight to Brazil. Some tears ensued... Ultimately, we booked a new flight to Sao Paulo that left last night around midnight.. then we got there around 9 o'clock in the morning, waited around until 1 pm (and explored the Sao Paulo airport for awhile), then flew 3 hours to Recife.. the people I sat next to on the plane were really nice.. Honestly, the Brazilian flight was the best-- it was short, there weren't people alllll up in my business (there was a guy on the flight to Miami who was practically on top of me), and the flight attendants were all attractive and gave us candies. :D Heheh. It's been fun trying to use my Portuguese too. SO. We landed in Recife, went out the gate, and were greeted by none other than Caio and his mom. :) It was so nice. But driving in Brazil is literally hell. There are so many cyclists and pedestrians weaving through cars, nobody stays in their lane, and mehh. The drive from Recife to Joao Pessoa was not the best. But yup. We're here in our little hotel room. I think we're going to walk around to try to find a bite to eat; then tomorrow morning I'm going running and to Caio's university. :))))
