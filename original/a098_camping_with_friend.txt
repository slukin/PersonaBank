My friend Jane#### and I went up to St Agnes/Skookumchuck Hotsprings for a camping trip.  This is the first time I have been camping in years.  We took the 5 hour trek starting Monday morning. Once we got there, we had ample opportunity to pick a sweet ass camping spot, right by the raging Lillooet River.  After setting up camp, we meet a fellow who stays up there for 3 months out of the year.  He took us for a hike, and showed us these pictographs that we approximately 600 years old. This is John, our 'tour guide'.  Our 10 min hike lasted about 2 hours, and we bushed bombed some pretty incredible terrain. This is an airplane landing strip just outside of the camping grounds. Our gourmet dinner - A cheese and jalapeno smokey with a glass of Malbec.  Yes, I broke my vegetarianism for the weekend, but we were camping, and I haven't had a smokey in 5 years.  It was damn good, and surprisingly, my stomach held up well.  Here is a short clip of a bear we saw on the way into the Hot Springs.  I am trying to upload more videos, but Blogger isn't cooperating, so I will try again later, or will post them on my Flickr.  I sadly have no pictures of the springs - due to hot water, nakedness, and mosquitos, I thought it would be best to leave the camera back in the camp.  Speaking of mosquitos, I am covered in bites, and just took an antihistamine to stop scratching.  All in all, this camping trip was a blast - I got to make a fire, sleep in a tent, hike, get dirty, eat smokeys, and sit in hot springs. Can't wait to do it again.
