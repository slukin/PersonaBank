Today when I arrived at my community garden plot, it actually looked like a garden. Not a weedy mess with maybe some stuff growing in it if you know where to look. We had hit the typical mid-summer mess of fast-growing weeds and no time to do anything about it. Plus all the rain had made a huge swamp and it was hard to get a moment to work when it wasn't actively pouring. I put in a bunch of time this past week, and it's paying off.  Along with free-standing non-weed-choked plants, I have now re-planted three of the beds with salad greens, spinach, and chard. And while the viability of the seeds was questionable, I accidentally unearthed some from the bed I planted 2 days ago and they had already started to sprout!  This marks the first time I have reclaimed the garden from a weed problem and turned it back into a productive garden. Other years I've never managed to get the late summer planting done.  I would've liked to get salad greens in 3 weeks ago, to harvest baby greens for salads along the way, but I'm still pretty pleased.  I've also got a few ideas for improving the garden next year. For one thing, the radishes fall down all over the place and make a mess when they go to seed, and they really could be removed once flea-beetle season has passed, which I didn't think to do this year. They're attracting cool butterflies, but I might be able to do that with some less floppy flowers.
