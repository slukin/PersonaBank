Jake came home on Saturday afternoon which was great because that was my 30th birthday. I am now 30. Hooray! It feels like this will be a good age.  I had fun getting ready for Easter with the kids. On Friday night we dyed our eggs. I boiled a dozen but a few of them cracked so we ended up with only nine. That was funny because our egg dye kit came with nine colors. So it didn't take us long at all to dye them all.  On Saturday morning we woke up bright and early to make it down to the town Easter Egg "Hunt." You can see from the picture that it isn't much of a hunt. Instead it turns into more of a trample, as kids scramble to get the eggs. Some eggs have tickets inside that you can redeem for nice prizes and Easter baskets. I'm usually glad that we don't find those eggs (although we WOULD take one of the bikes, of course.) I didn't get a picture of the actual egg gather up because it all happened so fast, and I was pretty concerned about losing my children in the chaos.  On Sunday afternoon we had our own Easter egg hunt at home. It was nice and quite, and the kids kept stopping to open eggs, instead of trying to find them all. But that's okay. It was nice anyway, and we were glad to have Jake home with us.
