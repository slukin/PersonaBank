Bob searched around his bag for his keys, quickly finding what he was looking for and turning the lock to open his door. He crept inside, feeling like he was going to get in trouble by some force for doing what he'd been doing the last few weeks. He removed his shoes, dropping his bag on the sofa, and walked into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. He numbly moved about the kitchen, trying to keep all the late nights, the moans, the bruising touches out of his mind. Without looking up, he raised his hand to get a mug out of the cupboard, but hit his hand hard on that same stupid fucking pan that always hung precariously just underneath it. He cursed, pulling his hand back to cradle it against his chest. Angry tears threatened to spill from his eyes as everything came crashing back. Instead of holding them back, he sank to the floor against the counter, holding his head in his hands, and sobbed, no longer caring who heard or what they thought.
