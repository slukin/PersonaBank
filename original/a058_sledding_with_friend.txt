One snowy afternoon when I was all bored and lonely I decided to call Jake. Jake asked what I was doing, I then answered with a bored statement. I told him that I was bored and that we should go play in the snow. He came, and we went.  The first stop was his house to get rope to make handles for the snow pans. We got them all ready to go. Then, after that, we went straight to our football field hill and panned down it going faster then the speed of light. Well, not really, but we went pretty fast.  Next we went to the top of hill where the buses meet to pick-up the elementary students and looked at sledding down the backside of the hill which down to the pool. I went down because I am 'crazy Anne#.' Jake didn't want to. I went down and wrecked as I went flying down the hill. It kinda hurt, but I was ok.  Finally, we went to our big M for Mapleton. (It's on a big hill behind the school.) We tried going down some hills but failed. It all together was a good fun time in the snow.
