I've really gotten into the Christmas spirit. On Black Friday I purchased Christmassy things for the apartment: table runner with snowmen and reindeer on it, stockings, a fake tree with lights (I'm a sell out), ornaments, little red bows to go on the tree, and a few plates to put in the living room. The last time I lived in a place that was decorated for Christmas was when my parents were still together and they divorced when I was 8. Wow, that's a long time ago. I can't even remember the last time I had a Christmas tree. Maybe junior or sophomore year of high school? Jake## is a good excuse to get back into the spirit!  He loved decorating the tree. Of course there are much more ornaments on the bottom half and along one side - the side that's closest to the couch where he could stand. I redistributed the ornaments which has been pretty useless because everyday he likes to redistribute them himself. It's quite cute. And after we were finished decorating, he gave me a big hug and said thank you. Awwww. Little kids who are not yours are just wonderful.  I need to do laundry. I have no socks. In fact, I am currently wearing Emily's socks for the third day in a row. Gross. They have been stretched out and are now bunched up around my heel. I gotta do something about this.  I went to Krogers last night on the sole intention of purchasing lemon juice. I left having spent $35. You see, there were poinsettias, one orange with glitter and then another red, and this really cool flower arrangement. The flower arrangement is pretty Thanksgiving-ish but I figured they die in a week. And besides, no one gives Thanksgiving due attention. Everyone always just looks over it to Christmas. Frankly, it annoys me. Also, I feel a bit guilty that I decorated the Christmas tree two days after Thanksgiving. The flowers are my way of making up for almost overlooking Thanksgiving.
