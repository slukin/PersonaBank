Was up all night chatting with a mate, it was just freakin awsome.. Up this night too, chatting with him. He's a really cool guy. Just a really awsome guy to talk with. Anyhow.. my day, just a useless day passing by again. Just sitting infront of the computer, doing nothing. Waited for my boyfriend to get home from work, so I could talk with him. The day had been sucky again. My dad argued again with me, for not being able to fix the household and stuff, yeah, I was trying to be anonymous, but now you all know Im a chick. Well, I told my boyfriend all about it and he cheered me up, as usual. Then there's this mate I got- Who explain his GODDAMNFEELINGS for me today, wich really freakin confused me. He's a really good mate, and I dont want to see him get hurt just because I choose my boyfriend over him. Well, f***.. life gets more and more screwed up for each and every day.Hmmm, I choose to- Keep him as a friend and continued talking with him, and he told me deeper and deeper how he felt. F*** OFF was all I wanted to write, but I couldn't. Didn't want him to get hurt, and I wanted to keep him as a friend. So we talked it through instead. Oh well, whatever.  I hate this shitty country.., there's nothing good about it. Another useless day passed by and another one to come. As soon I'm done with my education I'm gonna travel the world. And leave this loosercountry..  Well, I've slept like 20 hours of 150 or something, so Im not really clear in my mind.. damn bets, haha.
