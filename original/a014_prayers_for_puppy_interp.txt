Board: prayer and Healing Author: ######### #### we found out on Friday that our 11 year old puppy has kidney failure. Too extensive to do anything about it. Sudden, in that it was not noticed at her vet visit in June. She had a wonderful Saturday walking her favorite (nearby home) letterboxing spots. But, Monday am she began to crash and she is now too weak to eat or get up. We are terribly sad and feeling more so because we just learned about it Friday, we are a bit in shock. I know she is 'only a dog' as many would say. But, she is a beloved member of our family. And, her 19 year old 'owner' had to leave her this morning to go back to college. So, she is hours away as we spend our last few hours with our puppy-baby. So, prayers for soon-relief for Daffnee, and peace and healing for the family who loves her very much. Thanks folks!
