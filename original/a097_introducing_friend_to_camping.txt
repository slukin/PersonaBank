So this past weekend I went camping at Green Ridge State Park out in Western Maryland. I went out there to help introduce camping to my friend H.  It was car-camping. Nothing extravagant, but also lots of fun. We got in late on Friday night but it wasn't at all frustrating putting up the tent and setting up the first night. The next day we had oatmeal for breakfast and then headed out for a hike. We took our lunch and set-off. It was a pretty easy hike, right up until we realized that the trail ended and we had bushwack our way back to our camp. That night we enjoyed a few beers, some burritos, s'mores and banana boats. On Sunday we made scrambled eggs for breakfast and broke camp. It was an enjoyable weekend because the company was awesome and the living was easy. I'm hoping I'll get the chance to go camping one more time next month. We'll see if it works out.
