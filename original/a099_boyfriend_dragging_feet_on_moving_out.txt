51018a57d7eeef28938eb6e4 I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years, I'm 21 and he's 23. I've been living on my own for the past 2.5 years and I like it and all, but it gets lonely. He only sleeps over on his nights off. I moved down here to stay close to him, so we were easily accessible to each other and our relationship could continue to grow. Of course, I didn't tell him that, I figured he'd just know. He has this thing that if he moves out of his parents house, he's "leaving them" and that nothing will be the same. (My relationship with my family is horrible, and I told him it has nothing to do with me moving out) Then he tells me my first year living out, that once I finish schooling, get a stable job, and work on our relationship he'll consider moving in. He wants a perfect relationship before we move in, and I keep telling him there's no such thing, everyone fights. Now he tells me, he has no desire to leave him parents house for the next few years (since everything is paid for) and that when he moves out, he wants it to be out of state. I told him that we should move in together and stay close to his family, since he has such a fear of leaving them. Then he tells me, he'd like to move a few months before me, so he can live on his own, then have me go out there. I feel he's telling me excuse after excuse. "Slow and steady win the race" is his motto, and I can't stand it anymore! I'm not sure what to do, I can't keep having these talks with him without it's like me pressuring him, but I want to move forward. Please, advice would be so greatful!
