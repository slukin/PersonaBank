my ex-boyfriend and me broke up about 1,5 year ago.. we've been very best friends ever since. it almost was like we were still in a relationship, we still met up about every day and he always called me before he went to bed.. but we just didn't have sex anymore. during this time i hardly ever hung out with other people and i didn't have any other 'real' friends besides him. last week he told me he had fallen in love with this guy he met a few weeks ago.. now he hardly stays in contact with me and it almost feels like he kicked me out of his life. i do want to emphasize that i am over him, i've been with other people since the break up. and i doubt i even still like him as a friend and that i just spend all that time with him because there was no-one else. now i just sit at home doing nothing all day (i still have 2 months of vacation to go) and it's driving me crazy. i know i should probably go out and meet people, but i've always been socially 'challenged'. so that is quite hard for me. i don't even know what my question is, i just feel horribly lonely.
